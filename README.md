# Non-Linear_SVR_Explained

## Non-Linear SVR (Support Vector Regression)
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a regression model based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). While linear SVR assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, non-linear SVR handles more complex, non-linear relationships using the kernel trick.

### Advantages of Non-Linear SVR
Flexible Modeling: Captures complex relationships between features and target variables.
Kernel Adaptability: Handles different types of non-linear data by using suitable kernels.
Robust to Overfitting: Regularization ensures the model generalizes well to unseen data.
